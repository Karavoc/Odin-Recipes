    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
<h2>Marinade & Chicken:</h2>
<ul>1/4 cup (50g) sugar</ul>
<ul> 3 tablespoons garlic-infused oil</ul>
<ul>1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons peeled and finely grated fresh ginger</ul>
<ul>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon turmeric powder</ul>
<ul>2 teaspoons kosher salt</ul>
<ul>2 pounds (910 G) boneless chicken thighs, cut lengthwise into 1 inch (2.5cm) strips</ul>
<ul>bamboo skewers, or thin metal skewers</ul>

<h2>Sauce:</h2>
<ul>1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup (60 ml) hot water</ul>
<ul>1 /4 cup (60 ml) rice vinegar</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup (60 ml) low sodium soy sauce</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons Garlic-infused oil, preferably made with peanut oil or other vegtable oil</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoon sugar</ul>
<ul>2 teaspoons peeled and finely grated fresh ginger</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoons turmeric powder</ul>
<ul>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons dry-roasted peanuts, finely chopped (optional)</ul>

<h3> Preparation </h3>
<ol>For the Marinade: About 30 minutes to an hour before cooking time, whisk together the sugar, Garlic-Infused Oil, ginger, turmeric and salt in a large nonreactive bowl. Add the chicken and toss well to coat. Allow to marinate for about 30 minutes to 1 hour.</ol>
<ol>Meanwhile, Make the Sauce: Whisk together the hot water, and peanut butter until smooth in a nonreactive bowl. Whisk in vinegar, soy sauce, Garlic-Infused Oil, sugar, ginger and turmeric. Pour off about ½ cup (120 ml) and add the peanuts to that portion and set aside to use as a dipping sauce. Thread each piece of chicken onto a skewer, discarding the marinade.</ol>
<ol>Prepare your wood or propane-fired grill to a medium heat, or preheat your broiler to high with a rack about 4-inches (10 cm) below. In this case line a sheet pan with aluminum foil (for easy clean up) and place a rack on top.</ol>
<ol>Grill or broil the chicken satay, turning often and brushing with the reserved sauce (without the peanuts). Total cooking time will be about 7 or 8 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through, there should be some char marks here and there, but don’t overcook. Satay is ready serve with peanut dipping sauce.</ol>
