    <center><img src="../images/mayo.jpeg" alt="Garlic Chipotle Mayo "></center>

   <p>this has quickly become one of my favorite sauces for anything from chicken wings to french fries</p>
    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>1 large egg yolk</ul>
    <ul>1 tsp lemon juice or white wine vinegar</ul>
    <ul>1 cup neutral flavor oil such as canola, vegetable, or grapeseed oil</ul>
    <ul>1/4 tsp sugar</ul>
    <ul>1/4 tsp salt </ul>
    <ul>1/4 tsp pepper</ul>
    <ul>1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle chili pepper*</ul>
    <ul>1 - 3 teaspoons of FreeFOD garlic replacer *</ul>
    <ul>1 tbsp water as required</ul>

<h2> Preparation </h2>
    <ol> Place egg yolks, Sugar, salt and lemon juice in a food processor. Blend for 30 seconds until combined.</ol>
    <ol> With the processor running, very slowly drizzle in the oil in a thin stream until the mixture thickens and emulsifies into a mayonnaise. This should take about 3-4 minutes. If the mayo is too thick, add water 1 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is reached.</ol>
    <ol> Add chipotle chili pepper and garlic replacer to taste, and blend to combine. Adjust seasonings as needed.</ol>
    <ol> Transfer to a clean jar or airtight container and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.</ol>
    <ol> Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</ol>   


    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>Chipotle chili pepper: Although low Fodmap in small amounts chipotle chili pepper is spicy and may still trigger symptoms for some people with IBS. If you are sensitive to spicy foods, you can reduce the amount of chipotle chili pepper or omit it altogether.</ul>
    <ul>FreeFOD garlic replacer: This is a commercially available garlic flavoring that is made from garlic-infused oil and is low FODMAP. You can adjust the amount used to suit your taste preferences.</ul>
