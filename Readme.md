# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project. I'm building a simple recipe website to practice the HTML basics I've been learning.

## About This Project

Just a basic recipe site with a few of my favorite recipes. Nothing fancy yet - I'll come back and make it look better with CSS later. For now, I'm just focused on getting the HTML right.

## What I'm Working On

Through this project, I'm practicing:

- Setting up HTML pages properly
- Linking pages together
- Adding images
- Using lists and headings
- Git workflow and GitHub
- Writing this README!

Built with just HTML for now.
